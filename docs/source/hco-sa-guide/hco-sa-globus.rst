Download data with Globus
#########################

Many institutions use the `Globus <https://globus.org>`_ file transfer
utility, which has much higher data download speeds than normal SSH,
FTP, or HTTP connections.

If your institution uses Globus, you can download data from the
**GEOS-Chem Data (WashU)** endpoint to your computer system.  Ask your
IT support staff if Globus is supported at your institution.
